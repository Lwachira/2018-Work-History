# 2018 Work History

## What is this ?

The work here is a representation of work I did in 2018. I finished my university schooling at the end of 2017 and was invited back to work at the same company I did my internship at in [2016](https://github.com/Lwachira/2016-Internship) :partying_face:

> The aim was to build a billing application that would replace the legacy billing application. The new application needed to:
>- Cater for user flexibility.
>- Be blazing fast.
>- Adhere to modern software development methodologies.

I achieved this by using **C# 6**, a **modern Winforms UI Framework** and lastly migrating most of the necessary data using ETL processes in the form of **SSIS**.

## How does this work ?

As stated above the application makes use of data produced by an ETL package that is run daily through a cron job. Users would interact with the application to build their desired report. Provided they are happy with the report, they can export as a CSV document. 


## Why does this matter ?

This project demonstrates my ability to build a system that is able to process highly sensitive billing information in a safe and secure manner. It further demonstrated my ever-increasing ability to build for the end customer in mind. Lastly, it demonstrates my architectural skill in structuring the system at different layers of the stack (Networking, Database and UI).
